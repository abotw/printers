## 1. Introduction to Printers

A **printer** is a peripheral device that produces physical output (usually on paper) from digital data.
 Most consumer printers today fall into two major categories:

-   **Inkjet printers** — versatile, capable of printing photos and documents, generally lower upfront cost.
-   **Laser printers** — faster and more efficient for high-volume text printing, typically lower cost per page.

Modern home printers often support Wi-Fi, automatic duplex printing, mobile printing, and integrated ink tanks to reduce long-term consumable costs.

## 5. Usage Tips for My Printers

### General Usage

-   Connect via Wi-Fi or USB depending on environment.
-   For mobile printing, use **Epson iPrint** or **HP Smart**.
-   Enable duplex printing when possible to save paper.

### Ink Refilling

-   Always use **original or high-quality compatible ink**.
-   Refill slowly to avoid air bubbles in the ink tank.
-   Keep ink bottles tightly sealed when not in use.

### Print Quality Optimization

-   Run **nozzle cleaning** if colors appear broken or faded.
-   Use the **alignment tool** to fix skewed text or lines.
-   For photos, choose **high-quality photo paper** and adjust print settings accordingly.

### Maintenance Tips

-   Print something (even a single page) every **1–2 weeks** to prevent ink drying.
-   Keep the printer in a cool, dry environment away from dust.
-   Avoid turning the printer on/off too frequently; this can waste ink on cleaning cycles.
